This is a Singleplayer only playtest in order to test for stability, crashes, bugs and the AI itself.

You can report any crashes by sending log files from Logs and ServerLogs(singplayer games are hosted on a local server).
Send crashes and bugs into the discord: https://discord.gg/vxA5G4MugE
or if you dont like or dont have discord you can alternatively send them into this bug report form: https://forms.gle/iCLibbXusEgk4ceT7


After playing the game i'd apriciate any feedback negative or positive in the discord above
or this feedback form: https://forms.gle/2cnfxHjCxcBSrU9R9 (this is a different form from above!)

All of the art is WIP and half finished. Good chunks are already being repaced.

TLDR tutorial:
-Kill all enemy units to win.

-There is no RNG, all mechanics are deterministic

-You can turn units with right click

-Core combat mechanics are focused around determination and supression:
--Most abilities use up units determiation.
--Determination regenerates 1 a turn(Officer can greately boost this).
--Most shooting abilites have AOE supression effect which takes away determination from hit units.
--Getting hit while on 0 or 1 determination will cause a unit to panic which forcefully crouches it and removes a move point from next turn.
--Units with more than 1 determination will partially resist/dodge damage from most sources(especially explosions)

-Cover:
--The cursor has pips in every direction indcating cover
--Red: Full walls, impassible.
--Yellow: Tall cover 4 damage reduction, crouching behind it conceals the unit fully.
--Green: Short cover 2 damage reduction, 4 damage reduction on crouch.


-Sight:
--Bright tiles are fully vissible.
--Dark tiles are completely invisible.
--Purple tiles are partially vissible meaning you can see standing units there - but not crouching units.


-On the deployment screen you can place up to 8 units from a roster of 5 classes:
--Grunt: High health, High Damage, High Range. Special: 15 damage attack on units without determination
--Oficer: Mediocre stats, Highest sight range, Powerfull support abilities/buffs and Smoke screen.
--Heavy: A lot of health, A lot of determination, Can shoot 3 times if stands still. Very slow. Special: shoots multiple shots in a small area with high supressive effect.
--Scout: Fragile, Good Damage but Short Range, 2nd highest sight range. Very big movement range. Special: Uses up determination to restore action and move points.
--Specialist: Average stats, Explosive abilities. Best for denying cover and doing supression damage.
