@everyone here's what you can blame for lack of holdout updates. A game i've been working for on for about ~1 year at this point. A hardcore multiplayer-focused turnbased tactics game akin to xenonauts/xcom. I'm currently in need of a few playtesters so if it sounds intresting feel free to join the discord. This is a very early alpha build and everything you see in the screenshot is either a placeholder or WIP and subject to change
